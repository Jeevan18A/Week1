# Week1
#This project aims to build a machine learning-based recommendation system for suggesting the most suitable crop and fertilizer based on environmental factors and soil conditions. It leverages machine learning #algorithms, particularly Random Forest Classifiers, to predict the best crop and fertilizer combination.

#Objective:
#To predict the optimal crop and the type of fertilizer needed for a given set of agricultural parameters. The system helps farmers make informed decisions regarding crop cultivation and fertilizer application, #enhancing agricultural productivity and sustainability.
